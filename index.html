	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p> My name is Danielle and I'm a first year student, studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. This is not my first time studying 
		at a post secondary institution. I attended <abbr title="The University of Ottawa">UofO</abbr> and <abbr title="The University of Waterloo">UW</abbr> 
		to study Sociology. However, in 2005, I decided to pause my academic pursuits in favour of motherhood. I made this decision three courses shy of graduating 
		with a Bachelors of Sociology, minor in Womenâ€™s Studies. What I missed out on in university, I made up for with a career that span nearly twenty years, all 
		spent doing work the <strong>INSPIRED ME</strong> working with an amazing community with advocates from various a not for profits and charities.</p>

<p> I've worked in schools, shelters, youth drop in centres, health care settings and canvassed door to door. Regardless of the setting, each work assignment promised a litinany of 
	lessons learned from an eclectic mix of characters. Consequently, I was privy to many adventures and more often than not training felt like baptism by fire. Not that I minded, with a sensory 
	processing palette that favours BIG, BRIGHT and BOLD flavours with a tendency for risk taking. This coupled with attention and memory deficits, I preferred the variety of contract work boredom and on the edge of your seat/risk taking 
	and the opposite of risk adverse.I learned to rig lighting with a gittery roady, touring with Our Lady Peace, photographed nervous newbie nude models, did my best to 
	appear confident and remain calm, while working door and collecting drugs, sharps, and twice a stolen hand gun, working the door at an inner city drop inwith artists and researchers. Although, the job title I most identify with, is Story Teller or sometimes Story Keeper. Over the
	the years I've written stacks of grants and proposals. Writing a good proposal, means telling a compelling story and concurrently mapping out the mandate and history of an organization or project. 
	It is one of my favourite aspects of working in this sector. That and working for organizations committed to elevating the voices of those most impacted by adversity. Whether it be grassroots 
	community organizing or policy development and reform - the sharing of one's lived experience is paramount to action and necessary to inform meaningful change.</p>

<p> Being a full time student and a sole support parentcan sometimes feel like balancing an impossible list of tasks inside a pressure cooker. Every day I have to accept at least some level
	of mediocrity in favopur of getting things done.This is counter to how I've learned in the past We live  to two exceptionally resilent children West of Ottawa with our charasmatic shelter cat named, Sir Beef.
	My experience of motherhood is interwoven with my committment to advocacy and hope for a better future. </p>

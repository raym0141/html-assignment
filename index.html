	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> Hullo, my name is Danielle and I'm a first year student, studying Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. Many years ago, I decided to pause my academic pursuits 
	in favour of motherhood. I made this decision four courses shy of graduating with a Bachelors of Sociology, minor in Womenâ€™s Studies from the University of Ottawa. 
	What I missed out on in university, I made up for in life lessons and a career that spans twenty years working with amazing not for profits and charities.</p>

<p> I've worked in shelters and schools and with artists and researchers. however, the job title I most identify with is, Story Teller or sometimes Story Keeper. Much of my employment over 
	the years has involved grant writing. Writing a good proposal, means telling a compelling story and concurrently mapping out the mandate and history of an organization or project. 
	It is one of my favourite aspects of working in this sector. That and working for organizations committed to elevating the voices of those most impacted by adversity. Whether it be grassroots 
	community organizing or policy development and reform - the sharing of one's lived experience is paramount to action and necessary to inform meaningful change.</p>

<p> Today, in addition to being a full time student, I am a sole support parent to two exceptionally resilent children. We live West of Ottawa with our charasmatic shelter cat named, Sir Beef.
	My experience of motherhood is interwoven with my committmentn to advocacy and hope for a better future.</p>
